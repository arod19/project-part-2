# project-part-2

1- Idea

We are going to be looking at more tools and methods to polish our password cracking techniques, given that we already know how to use the material given in the first part of this password cracking series. We will focus on generating our own custom word lists that we can input on John The Ripper / Johnny, instead of using the default ones on those toolkits.


2 - Requirements

Very much like the first part, you will need Kali Linux OS and a strong understanding on how to use the command line.


3 - Objectives

The main objective for part 2 of the series is to further reinforce the need for complex, significant and thoughtful passwords knowing that attackers can be way more elaborate on how to hack passwords given the tools and methods that will be explained in this document.


4 - Tools and Materials Used

For the second part of the project, we are going to need two more toolkits already provided by Kali Linux, CeWL and Crunch. We are also going to be using the website www.thescore.com as an example. I will be again be running Kali Linux as a virtual image of VirtualBox software on my MacBook Pro as the host.
